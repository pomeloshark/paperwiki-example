Welcome to your wiki!

This theme was heavily inspired by worldbuilding websites such as [WorldAnvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/) and [Notebook.ai](https://www.notebook.ai/), both of which allow you to store articles and data in a wide variety of categories. I think both of those websites are fantastic, but not exactly what I was looking for, and so I never got as much use out of either of them as I hoped I would. I also tried out Tiddlywiki for a time, which was closer to what I wanted but still not as customizable as I would like. All of these websites I found a little too cluttered for my taste, whereas we're all familiar with Wikipedia and its layout and functionalities, so I built a Jekyll site that allowed me to recreate that. Hopefully I've succeeded enough for it to be useful to other people!

One of the benefits of a static site generator like Jekyll is privacy - you can serve it locally on your machine and browse it as if it were a fully fledged website, without ever posting anything to the internet. This is an approach I prefer, although you could also easily make it publicly viewable if you wanted (say, via Github Pages). Additionally, it's completely free --- no pricing tiers. You can create whatever categories you like, any time.

## Organizing your wiki

There are a lot of ways to navigate Wikipedia and explore its contents. I'm sure many people have never even been to the [contents page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents), but it lists several different methods of interacting with the site's contents: lists, outlines, overviews, glossaries, portals, categories, indices. Personally I like the concept of portals; have a look at [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Wine), for example, a kind of busy hub for all things relating to a given subject, with links to the other forms of navigations. You can organize your wiki however you want, but I chose to divide things up into very high level subject distinctions. I didn't want to replicate Wikipedia's exact categories, though, because I didn't want to recreate any of its assumptions, either: for example, the idea that people and culture can be clearly separated from each other, or that arts and sciences and technologies are subjects that can be neatly separated from each other.

Here's the extremely broad list I came up with:
1. Geography: this one is hard to sum up in a single word, but it's a pretty intuitive natural category --- the physical world, covering physical geography of the planet, landforms and water bodies and the processes that form them, climate, biomes and ecoregions, meteorology and oceanography
2. Biology: also pretty intuitive, the evolution of life on the planet, the different types of lifeforms, and the relationships between them
3. People: this one is much more nebulous, and all the remaining categories are really just very large subcategories of this one.
4. Languages
5. Places
6. Activities
7. Events
8. Figures
9. Items
